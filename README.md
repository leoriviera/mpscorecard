An MP can vote one of four ways on a division (the fancy name for a vote in the House of Commons). They can

- vote aye, or yes, for the motion
- vote noe, or against, the motion
- be absent from the division, counted as not voting
- not have voted on the motion, as they were not elected at the time.
